Matrix Layout : Column Major,
Coordinate System : Left handed, +Y up, +Z forward, +X right
Unit Scale: 1 unit = 1 meter
Angle Unit: Radian on api, Degree in UI but immediately converted to Radian on ui read
Euler angles order: YXZ (Yaw,Pitch,Roll)

Material System:
Material Settings: Material Options that requires pipeline compilation on change, for example: cull mode
Shader: contains hashmap where material settings are keys and compiled pipelines are values
Material data: bindless indices + basic data
Material: contains a ref to shader, material settings, and  material data index. To bind pipline,
pipline will  be fetched from shader using material settings and can be bind, then material data index can be
send via push constant.
