how to handle recreation of objects

shaders: end of the frame waitIdle recreate all pipelines.
material: (when material setting changes): same as shader but only for one material.
material data: scheduled buffer update (update buffer not in use and update the other on next frame).

Image: scheduled desc write, create new image, keep both alive, delete old when not used
Buffer that will be written every frame: ??

render space: wait idle, create new render space re-create all shaders with new render pass
