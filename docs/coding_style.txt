CPP

- Use uniform init syntax "{}" or "= {}", latter is better because can be aligned by formatter, first should be used when align
no needed, for example initializer list

- initilaztion preference order is like this
1 in member declarartion
2 in initilazer list
3 constructor (or make function)

avoid multi state initilaztion and make it  obvius  when its necesarry
